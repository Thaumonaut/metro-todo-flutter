# Overview

I have always wanted to get into making more mobile apps and wanted to learn flutter as a way to do so.  So I took the opportunity to build a todo app to learn flutter and the flutter framework. I also had the idea that I wanted to bring back the Metro style of mobile apps made popular on Microsoft windows and windows phone devices. I thought it was an interesting style to use for an app to make it unique and stand out while also adding a challenge to learn with making the app.

# Development Environment

I did most of my work in VSCode with the Flutter and Dart extensions. I also used Android Studio to for a bit of the designing and debugging early on with the app. I also used a few AI agents to help me with the development process so I could get the design I wanted and learn how they wrote code so I could learn from them. I found this to be a very helpful way to learn and get the app to where I wanted it to be.

# Future Work

There are a few things that I would like to add to the app in the future.
* Add a view to manage recurring tasks better
* Add a way to import and export tasks into the app
* Cleanup the recurring task creation workflow
